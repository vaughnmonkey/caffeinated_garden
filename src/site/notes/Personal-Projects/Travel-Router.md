Project Started 
- [ ] Do this Project
- [x] Research excisting versons and see if that lines up with what I want to do. ✅ 2025-04-17

## 2025-04-17 
- Researched the existing options and there are not many good diy projects so it might be easier and more useful to just buy one the open source options and add on a touchscreen interface
	- possible having a raspbery pi zero or something similar plugged into the router and running the interface if the router doesn't have good display support options.
- [ ]  compile the different options and see what the pros and cons are for each.

I've been randomly looking at stuff for this all week but haven't really started recording my notes 
### Research Notes

- What do I need out of a travel router?
	- Fast ⭐
	- easy to use with hotel wifi 
		- so I want to be able to intergrate a small screen into the case so that we can sign into hotel wifi networks with the router.
	- Open source (not absolutely requried but always prefered)
	- [[Knowledge/OpenWRT\|OpenWrt]] compatible 
		- I'm not sure of all the details on this but I think that it is the best router os option
	- small -> no bigger than a phone or very small tablet. ⭐ 
	- Compatibility with 5G 
		- would be a nice option to have but its not critical 

- What types are the existing options for travel routers?
