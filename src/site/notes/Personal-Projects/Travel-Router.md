Project Started

## 2025-04-17 
- Researched the existing options and there are not many good diy projects so it might be easier and more useful to just buy one the open source options and add on a touchscreen interface
	- possible having a raspbery pi zero or something similar plugged into the router and running the interface if the router doesn't have good display support options.
- [ ]  compile the different options and see what the pros and cons are for each.
