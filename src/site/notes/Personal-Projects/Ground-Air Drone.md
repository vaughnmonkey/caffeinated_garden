	- Unsure if this design using the same motor to spin both the wheel and propellers
		- but the design of the wheels containing the propeller is interesting/ useful

	- HOG- Hemispherical omnidirectional gimbaled wheel
		- 3-wheel bot controlled by a spinning hemisphere on a gimbal
		- could be used as both ground and flight control
			- would need to shift between spinning propellers and the wheel
			- unsure if gimballed propellers can successfully control and direct stable flight \
			- unsure if this style would be functional on uneven surfaces
				- but if flight functions work then drone could easily hover over difficult terrane
