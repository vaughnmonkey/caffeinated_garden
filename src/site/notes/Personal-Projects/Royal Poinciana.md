# [Royal Poinciana](https://www.bonsaiempire.com/tree-species/flame-tree): The Flame Tree
The Flame Tree is also called Royal Poinciana, fire tree or flamboyant tree. It is a tropical tree species from the legume family which produces large, fiery red or golden flowers that blossom from spring through summer.

The seed pods can grow 12-24" (30–60cm) long and will look out of proportion on a bonsai tree if you let them develop. The leaves are pinnately twofold and remind of fern leaves. The bark is greyish-brown, smooth on young trees and becomes rough with age. The tree grows fast, can become 10 meters (33ft) high and it takes on a natural umbrella shape which should also be aimed at when the flame tree is styled as a bonsai. In tropical climate the tree is more or less evergreen while in cooler subtropical regions it will be deciduous. The flame tree does not tolerate frost and needs temperatures between 50°F (10°C) and 68°F (20°C) in winter. If you need help identifying your tree, take a look at our [Bonsai tree identification](https://www.bonsaiempire.com/tree-species/bonsai-identification "Identifying your Bonsai tree") guide.


## Placement
During growing season a Sunny wind-protected place outside is best as long as night temperatures stay above 50 F. Drastic Temperature drops are not tolerated. 

From autumn to spring the trees must be placed in the house or a heated conservatory at temperatures between 50F and 68F. The cooler and darker the place the longer the flame tree will be dormant without leaves
