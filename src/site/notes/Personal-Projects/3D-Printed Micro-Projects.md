> Here is a compilation of my mini projects to make myself little quality of life 3d printed items. The line between these and a full 3d print project is completely arbitrary but revolves around my desire or lack of desire to make the project into its own note. Thingiverse links are in the headers incase any of you wanted to print these files.
# [Pen-Clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6786248) 

I made this little pen clip to attach my rite in the rain pen to it's notebook. It glues together around a binder clip and has worked pretty well. It took quiet a few iterations to get to this one. At first I was trying to make the entire thing 3d-printed but after multiple attempts (~4) I came to the conclusion that I wasn't going to get a strong enough clamping force to securely hold the pen without making it uncomfortably thick so I moved to find other methods. I happened to have a huge bag of these clips from a previous order I had made so I came up with this. It clips perfectly around the RiteInTheRain pocket pen both when it's open and closed!

# Nalgene 1L Bottle Repair (link to come once I make a final edit and upload the files)

I broke the little plastic part that connected the bottle and bottle cap together so I printed these 2 collars to go around the bottle body (at about 50% infill with a PETG filament) and the cap and then wove an easy paracord bracelet between them. I wanted a round cord so I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLqeCDTzceM) as inspiration. it turned out pretty nice so far, even though I think I made my cord a little too long. 
	This project took more iterations than I expected since at first I made the collars for both sides way too thin/small. The bottle side was too thin vertically and the opening for the top collar was too narrow horizontally and both of them where not sturdy enough for me to be comfortable with it being able to hold a full liter of water (Weight = Volume x Density).
