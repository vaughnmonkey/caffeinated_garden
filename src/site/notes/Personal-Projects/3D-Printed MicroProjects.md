Here is a compilation of my mini projects to make myself little quality of life 3d printed items. The line between these and a full 3d print project is completely arbitrary but revolves around my desire or lack of desire to make the project into its own note. Thingiverse links are in the headers incase any of you wanted to print these files.
# [Pen-Clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6786248) 

I made this little pen clip to attach my rite in the rain pen to it's notebook. It glues together around a binder clip and has worked pretty well.

# Nalgene 1L Bottle Repair

I broke the little plastic part that connected the bottle and bottle cap together so I printed these 2 collars to go around the bottle body (at about 50% infill with a PETG filament) and the cap and then wove an easy paracord bracelet between them. I wanted a round cord so I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLqeCDTzceM) as inspiration. it turned out pretty nice so far., even though I think I made my cord a little too long.
