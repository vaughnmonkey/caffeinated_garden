# Rocky Mountain Pine: _Pinus mugo_

For Bonsai, pines are especially popular and many people even regard them as the most typical Bonsai trees. Pine trees are evergreen, coniferous resinous trees with needles that appear in bundles of two to five.

The bark of older pine trees becomes scaly or flaky. Pines can grow in many different shapes in nature and can therefore be shaped in almost every known Bonsai style. In order to treat each pine species according to its nature, it is necessary to know if it produces only one or two flushes of growth during the growing season. Pine species with two flushes can be decandled in early summer to produce a second flush with shorter candles and smaller needles. Pine species with only one flush of growth must not be decandled because that would harm them, but the candles can be selected and shortened.

## Care for 0ne-flush Pines
	
### General Info
Unlike the  pine species mentioned above, most other pines will only produce one flush of growth each year. It could be fatal to remove all their candles, so they must be treated differently. Included in this category are the White Pine, Scots Pine, Ponderosa Pine and Mountain Pine.

### Placement
Place the pine outside in full sun. This supports healthy growth and helps decrease the needle size (needles grow longer if the tree doesn’t get enough sunlight). Pine trees are very hardy, but still should be protected during the winter when they are planted in containers.
