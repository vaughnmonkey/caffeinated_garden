- [ ] Do this Project

- Started fixating on bldc servos again so I'm adding my work to this project now so maybe I can actually use the bldc motors that I have for something useful. I would also love to integrate the ideas from [[Personal-Projects/EtherCAT+POE\|EtherCAT+POE]] so that I could have a BLDC ethercat servo for all my other motor projects. 

## Research stuff
- motor controllers 
	- [Moteus](https://github.com/mjbots/moteus) 
		- this seems like a good controller but I haven't figured out yet if it will take an encoder input or not because I want my servo to have absolute positional feedback
