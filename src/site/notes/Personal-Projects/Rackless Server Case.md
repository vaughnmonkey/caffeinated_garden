# Project Writeup 

## Mission
To create a fully 3d printed pc case in the style of a rack-mount case but with its own interlock system so that it doesn't require a rack to create a stable stacked server.

-  I've found 2 different 3d printed server cases from thingiverse that I'm going to adapt to this project along with a child lock for a drawer that I think if scaled up a little will make a perfect latch (2 0n each side) for holding the servers together along with a pair of dove tails running long wise along the top/bottom
	- I want to keep this case within the normal server case footprint so that if someone(me) makes this and then eventually gets a real server rack its easy to convert these into true rack-mounted computers.
