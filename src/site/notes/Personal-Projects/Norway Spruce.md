# Norway Spruce: European Picea abies
The spruce is an evergreen coniferous tree genus which is widespread in the northern hemisphere. Spruces can become 60 m (200ft) tall when mature and have a typical conical shape. The branches grow whorled.

Their needle-shaped leaves are are four-sided and attached singly to the branches. They stay on the tree for 4 to 10 years. The cones hang downwards. The branches bend downwards at their base but their tips point slightly upwards.Â 

Spruces are not easy to style as bonsai because they hardly backbud and wired branches tend to go back in their old positions again and again. There are wonderful examples of spruce bonsai nevertheless, especially of the Japanese species Picea jezoensis (Ezo spruce) and Picea glehnii and the European Picea abies (Norway spruce). The North-American Picea engelmannii is another good species, beside many interesting dwarf cultivars of diverse spruce species which are sold for garden purposes. Picea glauca 'Conica' (Alberta spruce) however is often tried but rarely makes good bonsai. The Picea mariana (black spruce) is widespread across Canada. Lastly, the Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens) is a popular species used in the US.
