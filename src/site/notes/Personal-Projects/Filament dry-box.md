# Filament dry-box

## Objective
- Take my existing filament drier ([food dehydrator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018UR4XJI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) and converting it into a filament dry box that I can actively print from. 

- Minimal Features
	- Hold multiple rolls of material
	- Dry while printing 
- Desired Features
	- automatic humidity control/sensing
	- expandability depending on how many reels of material I have on hand
