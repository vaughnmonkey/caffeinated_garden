# [Blue Jacaranda](https://www.bonsaiempire.com/tree-species/jacaranda):  _Jacaranda mimosifolia_
The Jacaranda mimosifolia is a subtropical tree native to south-central South America that is very popular as an ornamental tree because of its beautiful and long-lasting blue flowers. It has pretty compound leaves.

The Jacaranda is a semi-evergreen tree from South America and can become about 50' (15m) tall and 40' (12m) wide. It also grows in the southern states of the USA, in Mediterranean countries, South Africa and Australia. The Jacaranda has compound, fern-like leaves and beautiful blue or purple flowers which are up to 2" (5cm) long and grouped in large panicles. They appear in spring and early summer, and last for up to two months. The large woody seed pods contain numerous winged seeds. The Jacaranda's bark is thin, greyish brown and becomes scaly when the tree matures. The twigs are slender and slightly zigzag. Depending on the temperatures and amount of light, the tree can keep its leaves during the winter or drop them. In most cases the leaves fall before the flowers open. The Jacaranda is sometimes also referred to as the Brazilian rosewood, or blue jacaranda.
