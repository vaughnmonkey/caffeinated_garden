### My Understanding
```meta-bind
INPUT[progressBar:Understanding]
```


My current main focus is to use this to control servo/stepper motors via ethercat 
# What is LinuxCnC
LinuxCNC controls CNC machines. It can drive milling machines, lathes, 3D printers, laser cutters, plasma cutters, robot arms, hexapods, and more.

- Runs under Linux (optionally with real-time extensions).
- Simple installation on Debian and Ubuntu, or via our Live/Install DVD/USB images.
- Accepts G-code input, drives CNC machines in response.
- Active user community.
- Several different GUIs available.
- Compatible with many popular machine control hardware interfaces.
- Supports rigid tapping, cutter compensation, and many other advanced control features.

# Why to use 

The main advantage that I've been able to see is that LinuxCnC is much more robust and adaptable than GRBL which is also no longer being worked on.

Another main advantage is the open source nature so that I don't need to pay for licensing
