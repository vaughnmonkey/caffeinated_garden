# What is EDC?
- An Acremen that stands for Every Day Carry. 
	- it is the items that you carry everyday or at least that's the definition

In practice it can vary from stuff people carry when they leave the house or travel. Mine currently is split between the sling bag that I have all my True EDC stuff and a larger tool bag that I have in my backpack so I don't always have that with me but I have it the majority of the time.

# My EDC
