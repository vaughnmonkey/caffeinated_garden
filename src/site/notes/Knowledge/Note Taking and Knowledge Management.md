# Note Taking 

Here I'm compiling the different methods for taking notes around research and knowledge management. The next section [[Knowledge/Note Taking and Knowledge Management#Knowledge Article Creation\|Knowledge Article Creation]] will be about turning notes into easy to understand and consume knowledge transfer articles. I'm hoping this will be useful both in creating/improving my [[Knowledge/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] notes and in writing future [[Work/JBT/JBT\|JBT]] confluence articles. 

From my Research I've found this [article](https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-4-notetaking-styles-how-to-choose-a-digital-notes-app-as-your-second-brain/) about the 4 notetaking styles and I found the perspective interesting. The author classified notetakers into 4 distinct categories each with very different approaches to gaining, storing and managing their knowledge. Below are the different styles and their primary characteristics.

- The Architect 
	- Masters of Structure
	- want to fit all info into an **all-encompassing "ultimate system" with a clear hierarchy** 
	- Need to plan their system completely from the beginning because rearchitecting from scratch is labor and time intensive
- The Gardener 
	- think from the bottom-up 
	- cultivating many ideas and possibilities at the same time like seedlings sprouting in the wild
	- favors relationships and connections between the different subjects/knowledge
- The Librarian 
	- fundamentally practical relationship to information
	- deep desire to find and save the most useful information for specific purposes
	- Project oriented; and like to gather information relative to whatever is currently holding their interest
- The Student
	- often beginning their notetaking journey
	- complexity of their notes is limited to a specific short term use case (test prep, essay writing or job prep)
	- Usually a mix of practical lists or keeping track of travel itinerary alongside learning resources from books or classes
	- most common kind of notetaker 
		- also what everyone defaults to when short of time or energy 

I like the styles being broken down like this since none of these are inherently portraited as bad or wrong. I personally resonated most with the Gardener type, even just while trying to type these up I had a thought and hopped over to my [[Personal-Projects/Travel-Router\|Travel-Router]] router project to write down some of the random research that I had done for it, but I do also like some of the project oriented ideas that was mentioned in the Librarian style. But now I'll get into some specific note taking methods. After this short cuteness break:

## Notetaking Organizational methods

### [Q.E.C Method](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/learningstrategies/qec-method#:~:text=Steps%20*%20Question:%20List%20questions%20based%20on,Conclusion:%20Summarize%20the%20evidence%20into%20a%20statement.) (Question Evidence Conclusion) 

This method seems most similar to how I've been doing my Vault so far and the only method that I found which works well with a digital format. It consists of organizing notes around Questions that you want to answer. Meaning that you make sections starting with a question and then fill out bullet points below with evidence answering the question.
![Pasted image 20250416155319.png|600](/img/user/Knowledge/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250416155319.png)
 It seems like a great way of recording troubleshooting research or class/lecture notes but Idk if it would be as nice/intuitive for me to use as research notes. It could work in the sense of 1 over reaching question like "How does *blank* technology work?" and then breaking that into smaller sub-questions. 
### The Cornell Method

This method organizes notes into easily digested summaries by grouping the Main points, details, study cues, and summaries all on one page. 
![Note-Taking-Cornell-Method 1.webp|600](/img/user/Knowledge/attachments/Note-Taking-Cornell-Method%201.webp)
This method seems good on paper but doesn't work with digital notes at least not in [Obsidian notes](https://obsidian.md/) since its mostly linear but maybe in other software or on paper this could be helpful to some.

### The Mapping Method

Mapping is a visual way to organize notes and can be helpful in reinforcing the relationships between topics. 
![Note-Taking-Mapping-Method.webp|600](/img/user/Knowledge/attachments/Note-Taking-Mapping-Method.webp)
This one is very situational and defiantly can't be done in obsidian, in real time, but you can add in [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) charts into notes so that you can have nice flowcharts in your notes. Along with pretty much any other kind of chart that you can think of.  
### The Outlining Method

Outlining is a note taking method that uses headings and bullet points to organize topics. This method is most useful when learning about topics that include a lot of detail.
![Note-Taking-Outlining-Method-1.webp|600](/img/user/Knowledge/attachments/Note-Taking-Outlining-Method-1.webp)
This is my default method for research notes and makes the most sense to me. Outlines make it very easy to expand on topics naturally as I discover more information about it.
### The Charting Method 
Charting uses columns to organize the topics. This claims to be useful for lessons that cover a lot of facts or relationships between topics.
![Note-Taking-Charting-Method.webp|600](/img/user/Knowledge/attachments/Note-Taking-Charting-Method.webp)
 I don't see how there's ever enough room to write anything significant in these narrow columns, unless its in an excel sheet or something like that where I could type how ever much I wanted to fit inside the column.
### The Sentence Method
The Sentence note taking method is simply writing down each topic as a jot note sentence. This method works well for fast paced lessons where a lot of information is being covered. 
![Note-Taking-Sentence-Method.webp|600](/img/user/Knowledge/attachments/Note-Taking-Sentence-Method.webp)
This just seems like they gave a proper name to word vomiting everything that you hear/see about the lesson or topic. It doesn't really feel like its "organized"
