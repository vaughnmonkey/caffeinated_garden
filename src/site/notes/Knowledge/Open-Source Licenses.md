# Research 
- Licenses fall into 2 main categories: 
	- Permissive -> allow users to use, modify and distribute software/hardware without maintaining the original license original license
	- Copyleft -> require that any derivative works be distributed under the same license, ensuring that the software remains open and freely available
		- Weak -> This only requires that the source code of the original or modified work is made publicly available, while the rest of the code used together with the work doesn't have to be published under the same license.
		- Strong -> If a source code is protected by a strong copyleft license, then the derivative software needs to be publicly available under that license as well. This includes all linked libraries and components within the software.
