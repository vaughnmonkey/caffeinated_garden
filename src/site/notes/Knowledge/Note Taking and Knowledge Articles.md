# Note Taking 

Here I'm compiling the different methods for taking notes around research and knowledge management. The next section [[Knowledge/Note Taking and Knowledge Articles#Knowledge Article Creation\|Knowledge Article Creation]] will be about turning notes into easy to understand and consume knowledge transfer articles. I'm hoping this will be useful both in creating/improving my [[Knowledge/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] notes and in writing future [[Work/JBT/JBT\|JBT]] confluence articles. 

From my Research I've found this [article](https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-4-notetaking-styles-how-to-choose-a-digital-notes-app-as-your-second-brain/) about the 4 notetaking styles and I found the perspective interesting. The author classified notetakers into 4 distinct categories each with very different approaches to gaining, storing and managing their knowledge. Below are the different styles and their primary characteristics.

- The Architect 
	- Masters of Structure
	- want to fit all info into an **all-encompassing "ultimate system" with a clear hierarchy** 
	- Need to plan their system completely from the beginning because rearchitecting from scratch is labor and time intensive
- The Gardener 
	- think from the bottom-up 
	- cultivating many ideas and possibilities at the same time like seedlings sprouting in the wild
	- favors relationships and connections between the different subjects/knowledge
- The Librarian 
	- fundamentally practical relationship to information
	- deep desire to find and save the most useful information for specific purposes
	- Project oriented; and like to gather information relative to whatever is currently holding their interest
- The Student
	- 
## [Q.E.C Method](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/learningstrategies/qec-method#:~:text=Steps%20*%20Question:%20List%20questions%20based%20on,Conclusion:%20Summarize%20the%20evidence%20into%20a%20statement.) (Question Evidence Conclusion) 

This method seems most similar to how I've been doing my Vault so far and the only method that I found which works well with a digital format. It consists of organizing notes around Questions that you want to answer. Meaning that you make sections starting with a question and then fill out bullet points below with evidence answering the question. It seems like a great way of recording troubleshooting research or class/lecture notes but Idk if it would be as nice/intuitive for me to use as research notes. It could work in the sense of 1 over reaching question like "How does *blank* technology work?" and then breaking that into smaller sub-questions.
