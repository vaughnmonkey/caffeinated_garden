# Note Taking 

Here I'm compiling the different methods for taking notes around research and knowledge management. The next section [[Knowledge/Note Taking and Knowledge Articles#Knowledge Article Creation\|Knowledge Article Creation]] will be about turning notes into easy to understand and consume knowledge transfer articles. I'm hoping this will be useful both in creating/improving my [[Knowledge/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] notes and in writing future [[Work/JBT/JBT\|JBT]] confluence articles. 
## [Q.E.C Method](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/learningstrategies/qec-method#:~:text=Steps%20*%20Question:%20List%20questions%20based%20on,Conclusion:%20Summarize%20the%20evidence%20into%20a%20statement.) (Question Evidence Conclusion) 

This method seems most similar to how I've been doing my Vault so far. It consists of organizing notes around Questions that you want to answer. Meaning that you make sections starting with a question and then fill out bullet points below with evidence answering the question. It seems like a great way of recording troubleshooting research or class/lecture notes but Idk if it would be as nice/intuitive for me to use as research notes. It could work in the sense of 1 over reaching question like "How does *blank* technology work?" and then breaking that into smaller sub-questions.
