# Note Taking Methods

Here I'm compiling the different methods for taking notes around research and knowledge management. The next section [[Knowledge/Note Taking and Knowledge Articles#Knowledge Article Creation\|Knowledge Article Creation]] will be about turning notes into easy to understand and consume knowledge transfer articles. I'm hoping this will be useful both in creating/improving my [[Knowledge/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] notes and in writing future [[Work/JBT/JBT\|JBT]] confluence articles. 
## [Q.E.C Method](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/learningstrategies/qec-method#:~:text=Steps%20*%20Question:%20List%20questions%20based%20on,Conclusion:%20Summarize%20the%20evidence%20into%20a%20statement.) (Question Evidence Conclusion) 

This Method consists of organizing notes around Questions. Meaning that you make sections starting with a question and then fill out bullet points below with evidence answering the question. It seems like a great way of recording troubleshooting research or class/lecture notes but Idk if it would be as nice/intuitive for me to use as research notes.
