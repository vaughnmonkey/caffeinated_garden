# The Mechatronics Handbook 2nd Ed

## 1 What is Mechatronics
- The 5 areas of specialty in mechatronics
	- Physical systems modeling
	- sensors and actuators
	- signals and systems
	- computers and logic design
	- software and data acquisition


## 2 Mechatronic Design Approach
- Mechatronic Systems can be subdivided into:
	- Mechatronic systems
	- Mechatronic machines
	- Mechatronic vehicles
	- Precision mechatronics
	- micro mechatronics

### 2.5 Concurrent design Procedure for Mechatronic Systems
There are 5 important design steps to take a purely mechanical system and make it into a fully integrated mechatronic system
- Design Steps
	1. addition of sensors, actuators, microelectronics, control functions
	2. integration of components (hardware integration)
	3. integrations by information processing (software integration)
	4. redesign of mechanical system
	5. creation of synergetic effects
