# 1 Introduction to Fluid Power

- Learning objectives
	- Explain what fluid power is 
	- Differentiate between the terms hydraulics and pneumatics
	- Understand the difference between fluid power systems and fluid transport systems
	- Appreciate the history of the Fluid power industry
	- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of fluid power 
	- Specify the basic components of fluid power systems 
	- Appreciate the size and scope of the fluid power industry
	- Identify the categories of personnel who are employed in the fluid power industry

## 1.3 Advantages of Fluid Power

1. Ease & Accuracy of control
2. Multiplication of force
3. Constant force or torque
4. Simplicity, Safety, Economy

### Drawbacks
must be properly designed and installed or they will leak and/or fail critically

## 1.5 Components of a Fluid Power System


- Hydraulic System
	1. A tank (reservoir) to hold the hydraulic oil
	2. A pump to force the oil through the system
	3. An electric motor or other power source to drive the pump
	4. Valves to control oil direction, pressure and flow
	5. An actuator to convert the the pressure of the oil into mechanical force or torque to do useful work. Actuators can either be cylinders, to provide linear motion, or motors (hydraulic) to provide rotary motion
	6. Piping, which carries the oil from one location to another. 

- Pneumatic System
	1. An air tank to store a given volume of compressed air
	2. A compressor to compress the air that comes directly from the atmosphere
	3. An electric motor or other prime mover to drive the compressor 
	4. Valves to control air direction, pressure and flow rate
	5. Actuators, which are similar in operation to hydraulic actuators
	6. Piping to carry the pressurized air from one location to another

## 2.2 Fluids
|    Parameter    |                      Liquids                       |              Gas               |
|:---------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
|     Volume      |                   Has own volume                   | volume determined by container |
|      Shape      |     takes shape of container up to it's volume     |   completely fills container   |
| Compressibility | mostly incompressable for engineering applications |      readily compressable      |

## 2.3 Specific Weight, Density, and Specific Gravity

- Specific Weight- weight per unit of volume
	-  $\gamma=\frac{weight}{volume}$ 
- Specific Gravity- specific weight of a fluid divided by the specific weight of water
	-  $(SG)_{oil}=\frac{\gamma_{oil}}{\gamma_{water}}$ 
	- SG of water is 1
- Specific Density- mass per unit volume
	-  $\rho=\frac{mass}{volume}$ 
	-  $SG=\frac{\gamma}{\gamma_{water}}=\frac{g\rho}{g\rho_{water}}=\frac{\rho}{\rho_{water}}$ 

## 2.4 Force, Pressure, and Head
- Pressure- force per unit area
	-  $p=\frac{F}{A}$
- Head- pressure developed at the base of a certain height of fluid
	- does not depend on the cross-sectional area of the liquid column, only on the column height and specific weight
	-  $p=\gamma H$  

- Absolute Pressure- pressure measurement that takes the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere into account
	-  $p_{abs}=p_{gage}+p_{atm}$ 

## 2.6 Bulk Modulus
- Bulk Modulus- measure of a fluid's incompressibility 
	-  $\beta=\frac{-\Delta p}{\frac{\Delta V}{V}}$ 
	- Bulk modulus of oil changes somewhat with pressure and temperature but is largely negligible
