# 1 Introduction to System Dynamics

- Mathematical modeling Procedure
	1. Draw a schematic diagram of the system, and define variables
	2. Using Physical laws, write equations for each component, combine them according to the system diagram and obtain a mathematical model
	3. To verify the validity of the model, its predicted performance, obtained by solving the equations of the model, is compared with experimental results
		- this is the only way to find validity of a mathematical model 

# 2 The Laplace Transform
- mostly just use the tables and do partial fraction decomposition

# 3 Mechanical Systems


# 4 Transfer Function Modeling Approach
