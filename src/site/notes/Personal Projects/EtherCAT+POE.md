# Project Writeup 

## Mission

Create a Ethercat+Power connector board based on the [TI Example Design](https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDA-01461#description) and [EtherCAT servodrive](https://hackaday.io/project/181058-ethercat-servodrive) project!
I want to be able to power and run entire projects thru a single ethernet cable! This would improve my understanding and usage of the Ethercat protocols and make designs much simpler if I have a reliable way of routing power and data throughout a project with minimal effort.
